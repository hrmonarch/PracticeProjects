'''
For a hard-coded function this script will calculate the approximate 
roots as per Newton's Method algorithm.  

For new functions to be calculated this will require changes and 
considerations to be made to the script.


Note:  This script is a modified version of the same script 
located here:

import sys

# Our function - Change this when you have a new function

    return 0.1*x**4 + 0.15*x**3 - 4* x**2 + 11*x - 6

# Our derivitive of our function - Change when when you get a new function.  
def f_prime(x):
    return 0.4*x**3 + .45*x**2 - 4*x**2 + 11

            return x
        x = x - f(x)/f_prime(x)
    return x

This script requires two arguments to be be run by itself.
The first is our initial 'x' value that is effectively a guess.  Make it a good one and 
The algorithm will take much less time.

The second value is the number of iterations for the method to take to find its 
approximations.  This method runs in polynomial time, so try to keep the number low.  
That being said, too few iterations may prove to give you poor results.
